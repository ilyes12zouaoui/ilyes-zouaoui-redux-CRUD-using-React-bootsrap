ilyes zouaoui redux crud is a small project using
redux-starter-kit (https://redux-starter-kit.js.org/introduction/quick-start)
librairy which help us to create redux store, action creator and
reducers in a much simpler way then we used to do before using redux
library directly, also it includes redux-thunk middleware by default
for handling asynchronous operations, and we use react-redux library
to be able to connect our react app with our redux solution in a
simple way, this project was made for learning how to manage our
react application state in a more efficient way using redux, i wish
it helps you.

to use :
npm install
npm start
